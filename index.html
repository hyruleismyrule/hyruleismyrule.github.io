                The three-footed Golden Crow lived in the sun.
                At midnight it arose from bottom of the sea, emerging by the divine Mulberry Tree at dawn and roosting
                in the West at dusk.
                Time ran on and the cycle began again.

                A worshipper builds a temple, makes offerings, day and night praying for a miracle: "Bless my people,
                let the sun shine, let the rain fall, fill my belly at harvest time".
                Inscriptions in the stone, blown away by the wind; who will remember them?

                ❤️[Intimate Date]
                The world was in chaos. Monsters ravaged the land while heroes took up arms against them.
                One hundred years ago, the Black Dragon fell into the Eastern Sea, churning the water and washing
                wickedness from the earth. It rained then for many months and peace returned for a time.
                ——I never made wishes until you came along.</p>

                💜[Fragrant Date]
                There is a creature on Hope Mountain called Baize who knows the names of the demons and the gods and the
                true nature of all things.
                The sun and stars lose their luster, demons and beasts run amuck.
                One blow from Baize and the menace melts away.

                There is a beast that dwells on Mount Artemis that drinks rain and walks on green jade.
                Lying among evening primroses and fragrant grasses, it has five tails and makes a noise like striking
                stones.
                ——I will decide my fate.</p>
