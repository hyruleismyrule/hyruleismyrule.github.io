CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    !!!*****************************************************!!!
    I'm changing my project because it is very difficult to get 
    the required URL for youtube videos, and after several
    attempts I still can't get it, so I can't move on with that
    project idea. I'm now going with my backup idea.

1. What is the title of your program?

    Hangman

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

    This is a game that will help keep children entertained and can help
    them increase thier vocabulary.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

    I will learn how to 

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    math, draw2d (from earlier in the semester)

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    I will need to use several functions so that I can call them when the user makes a choice.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

    I will write a test function for generating the hangman character and checking the words.
