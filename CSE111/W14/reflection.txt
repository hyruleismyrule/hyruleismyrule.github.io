Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

        When I was creating my hangman project I used functions that wouldn't return any data.
    Instead, based on user input they called another function that called the first function again
    until the user ented the correct word, chose to quit, or used up all thier attempts. These 
    functions just passed the updated paramaters to eachother. It was very helpful to be able to 
    have a function calling loop because the words weren't always the same length.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

        Test functions are very helpful not only because they test functions and make sure that
    they work, but when I write them I have to have a very good understanding of how my 
    function works, so I often rewrite the functions so that they are more efficient. I also have
    to be aware of all the unexpected user inputs and I often find problems that I need 
    to go back and solve.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

        When my program has a problem the first thing that I do is check the error to find the 
    function and line that has the problem. I then use print statements to check what the values
    are at the time of the issue and how far the program works. I usually solve the problem here,
    but if I can't then I usually google the error or ask someone else for help.
    The test functions usually help me to find problems that I didn't know that I had because I 
    I am trying unexpected inputs or I didn't notice the wrong values. One thing I can do to improve
    the process is to write test functions as I go so that I can make sure that each function is
    full proof before moving on.
