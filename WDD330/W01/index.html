    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <a href="story-editor/story_editor.html">Story Editor</a>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This week was mostly review, which was helpful because I havenâ€™t used javaScript in a while. It took me a long
      time to figure out how Local Storage worked, but I was eventually able to finish the Story Editor assignment.

    <p>The SitePoint Master Mobile UX class was very helpful and interesting. I really liked that he brought up that
      using one hand makes it difficult to reach the top of the screen, and I have noticed that more and more websites
      and apps have been putting navigation on the bottom, sometimes they keep one at the top, but they generally put
      the most important buttons at the bottom. I had seen a lot of scrolling advertisements and for me, I find them a
      lot more engaging to look at.
