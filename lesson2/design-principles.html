            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <p>Hick's Law sometimes called the Hick-Hyman Law states that the more stimuli to choose from, the longer it
                takes the user to make a decision on which one to interact with. The formula is RT = a + b log2(n). RT
                is reaction time, (n) is the number of options, a and b are other measurable factors in the situation.
                For Design, Hick's Law simply means optimizing a page to have less choices for the user to make so their
                reaction is faster and they can get the information that they need quicker.</p>

            <h2>Fitts' Law</h2>
            <p>Fittsâ€™s Law says that the time it takes a user to move their mouse to a button is the distance to the
                button divided by the size of the button. The larger the distance and the smaller the size of the
                button, the longer the reaction time. This means that for designers it is important to keep the size of
                the buttons large enough so that they can be easily clicked so the time that the user spends on the
                website is optimized.

            <h2>The Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <p>The Rule of Thirds is a method that designers and photographers use to make aesthetic designs. To use the
                rule of thirds divide up a site into thirds vertically and horizontally and place dots where the lines
                cross. These are where the main focal points of the site or image should be placed. The human eye is
                automatically drawn to these points, however it sees the top left corner to be 41% more appealing, the
                top right 20%, bottom left 25%, and the bottom right 14%.
