                <p>Hick's Law sometimes called the Hick-Hyman Law states that the more stimuli to choose from, the
                    longer it
                    takes the user to make a decision on which one to interact with. Quizlet's log-in interface only has
                    three options to link an account with and one manual sign in to keep the page simple.

                <p>Fitts’s Law says that the time it takes a user to move their mouse to a button is the distance to the
                    button divided by the size of the button. The larger the distance and the smaller the size of the
                    button, the longer the reaction time. D&D Beyond has the most important buttons for rolling ability
                    checks taking up most of the screen. They are also right beside eachother to minimise clicking
                    distance.

                <p>The Rule of Thirds is a method that designers and photographers use to make aesthetic designs. To use
                    the
                    rule of thirds divide up a site into thirds vertically and horizontally and place dots where the
                    lines
                    cross. These are where the main focal points of the site or image should be placed. The human eye is
                    automatically drawn to these points. On Wolfram Alpha's page the grids cross on the most useful
                    buttons:
                    The Step-by-Step Solutions, Units & Measurements, and More Topics.
