      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Our Purpose at Epic Water Rafting is to provide quality services to our
        customers through our field guides, equipment, and customer services. We
        have many rafting locations across the United States that are Epic. Our
        motto is “We strive to be the best in the business.” We believe that
        anyone should be able to water raft without feeling unsafe or unhappy.
        Our company founder Megan C. Rafter had a passion for white water
        rafting since she was a child growing up on the river side, and we want
        to share that passion with the world, and make every experience Epic.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our target audience is children and adults between the ages 12-45 to
        minimize health and safety concerns. Customers should be free from high
        blood pressure, back, neck, or heart conditions that could be aggravated
        by this adventure. Our target families are those of the middle to upper
        financial range. Our customers are looking for a quality water rafting
        experience, with minimal planning on their part. They are looking for
        that feeling of thrill and excitement only provided by Epic Water
        rafting. Most potential customers will be accessing our website through
        desktop and mobile phones, so they can easily make reservations and
        change anything if necessary.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
