      <p>I am attending BYUI online majoring in Applied Technology.</p>
      <p>I love to draw, play video games, and watch TV.</p>
      <p>
        I have three cute cats: Anya a calico who is grumpy, Natasha a small
        maine coon, and a very small manx named Phinn who is terrified of
        everything. She is the definition of "scardy cat."
      </p>
      <p>I graduated High School this past June as the "class of COVID-19"</p>
      <p>
        I have been doing a little sidework working on two websites with my Dad
        who has been doing this for 20 years.

        This is only my first semester at BYUI, but I can definitly feel the
        spirit, and God's hand in how its run.

        I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
        all my life and I love being a part of it.
