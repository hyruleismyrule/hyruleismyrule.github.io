          Rivers
        </h1>
        <h2>
          Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho
        </h2>
        <p>
          Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
          Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River
          of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of
          folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of
          the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the
          hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
          commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
          ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and
          provide shelter from sun or rain when needed. Let's not forget the
          rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
          undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the
          water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
          slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
          summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to
          appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

        <h2>
          Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah
        </h2>
        <p>
          Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
          land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river
          and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and
          great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from
          from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and
          boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence
          of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater
          opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done
          in 6 days Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National
          Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history
          that the canyon tells.

        <h2>
          Grand Canyon, Arizona
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
          river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
          Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
          breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.
          The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but
          with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
          CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
          rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
          accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
          However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating
          scale, so we often refer to both.
