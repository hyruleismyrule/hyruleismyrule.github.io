            <div class="thefront card-1">Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</div>

            <div class="theback card-1">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however
              that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if
              their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored
              stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The
              areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you
              might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also
              comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all
              without telling stories...some of which are even true!</div>

            <div class="thefront card-2">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?
            </div>

            <div class="theback card-2">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk.
              To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at
              least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on
              land.
              Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device
              (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth
              and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the
              event that you fall out of the raft.</div>

              We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the
              morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per

            <div class="thefront card-5">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</div>

            <div class="theback card-5">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe
              a common day on the river.
              Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky.
              Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and
              prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes,
              history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot
              you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides
              prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven
              brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even
              be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you
              thought were possible.</div>

            <div class="theback card-6">If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If
              you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</div>
