<h1>Business Venture</h1>
<p>I would like to own a business that would buy and sell computers and computer parts. This would allow me to work from home while also work on things that I love. I am about to get a job at a company that I will work on custom computers all day long! This would prepare me sufficiently to own this kind of business.</p>
<p>Starting this kind of business would require that I obtain some licenses and purchase computer parts. I would then need to get a website and start to advertise for my business. After we get some good business we can expand into a warehouse where the computer parts are stored, built, and shipped.</p>
